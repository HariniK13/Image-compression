# Image-compression

# Objective
In the field of Image processing, the compression of images is an important step before we start the processing of larger images. The compression of images is carried out by an encoder and output a compressed form of an image. In the processes of compression, the mathematical transforms play a vital role.

# Abstract
The website provides an interactive platform where users can upload their images and witness the transformative effects of various compression techniques. Through an intuitive user interface, users can explore different compression options such as saturation, brightness, inversion, gray scale effect and observe the resulting changes in image quality and file size. 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been used to enable dynamic interactions and real-time image processing. The website utilizes HTML's input elements for image upload, CSS for responsive and visually appealing designs, and JavaScript for implementing compression techniques and manipulating the images. 

# Approach
Thus, In this project we come up with an idea of developing a website in which the user can click images on phone or laptop or desktop and select an existing image and compress it into small size without losing much of image quality using image compressing technique.By reducing high-resolution images with lower ones that take up less space but deliver same quality will also free up space on your Smartphone.
